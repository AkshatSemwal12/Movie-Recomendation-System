This Movie Recommendation System is a full-stack project designed to recommend similar movies based on a selected film using TMDB's dataset from Kaggle. 

The system involves data preprocessing to remove irrelevant features, followed by the application of cosine similarity to identify the top 5 closest movies to the selected one.
 
The project includes a web application built with Streamlit.
